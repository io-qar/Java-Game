# Pocket Monsters

## What is the game about?
We made a text-based RPG-style game in Java. It is heavily inspired by the Nintendo Pokémon games. 

The game begins in Pallet Town, where you receive a Pokémon from Professor Oak. You then walk around the map, finding other Pokémon and battling them with your own Pokémon. If you look around carefully, you may find some items that you can add to your inventory. These include Health Potions to heal your Pokémon, Revives to bring them back to life, and Pokéballs that allow you to catch another Pokémon in battle. A small hint: try to weaken the enemy Pokémon before throwing a Pokéball to increase your chances of catching it. 

The final goal is to defeat the gym trainer. He owns a very strong Pokémon, so make sure you have a solid collection of Pokémon to back you up before engaging in battle with him!
